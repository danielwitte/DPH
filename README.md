# Diabetes from a Population Health Perspective
This repository contains the materials (under development) for the online course and accompanyin book 'Diabetes from a Public Health Perspective'.
The course is aimed at university-level students in health related professions who wish to understand what diabetes is, why it is an increasing global problem and how we can approach it from a population health perspective.

The course covers various topics with direct relevance to our current understanding of diabetes as a societal and public health challenge, but also touches on the point of view of individual patients and health care providers.

### Prerequisites
In order to follow the course materials, students need undergraduate-level general knowledge of human physiology, medicine, epidemiology, statistics and public health sciences. Key concepts are reviewed briefly where relevant, and links to resources for background and further learning are provided.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to start is by reading the course introduction. Students with limited experience may benefit from following the linear structure of the course, while more advanced students can skip over topics they feel sufficiently familiar with. More advanced topics build on earlier chapters but links back are provided.
